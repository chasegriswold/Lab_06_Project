 Lab 06 Analog Embedded Systems

The lab involves initializing LED pins and configuring a potentiometer's input for Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC). Each (of 4 total) LEDs will light up as we increase in value. The resolution for 8-bit ADC is 256 taps, so we can set up each LED for 64 taps each. This lab also includes setting up a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to generate analog waveforms using a selected GPIO pin, and we will hook up that pin to an oscilloscope to see if we correctly implemented the design.
